	<p> Vinesse Charles, Housing Coordinator at the Flatbush Development Cooperation, tells her clients that one call to 311 is not going to fix the issue. “You can't just whisper. One, call a month is a whisper. You need to scream ‘I need freaking hot water and heat,” she said.</p>

	<p> Limited resources prevent Housing Preservation and Development inspectors from getting to many of the issues reported. In the month of October alone, 311 received 3,583 complaints in Community District 14 alone. </p>

	<p> “Even if your situation is a whole lot smaller than somebody else's situation, you gotta make so much noise that they're running over,” said Charles. </p>

	<p>Many buildings in Flatbush are older and suffer lack of maintenance letting plumbing and electrical units left to deteriorate. The city’s Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) sends inspectors once issues are determined severe enough. </p>

	<p>The problems are expensive, and the city ends up footing the bill most of the time. After Cuomo declared a state of emergency, he ordered the appointment of an independent monitor, who would oversee how the NYC Housing Authority would spend it’s $250 million budget to make emergency repairs to the city’s worst infrastructure. </p>

	<p>It’s tough to make the assertion that the lack of heat is tactic of tenant harassment. Landlords in Flatbush and other gentrifying areas are notorious for forcing tenants out by neglecting repairs and damaging personal property. Charles said, “I couldn't say for sure that it's a harassment tactic, I don't know that. It could be that it's too expensive to fix, a lot of these buildings are old.”</p>

	<p>A lot of these buildings are gentrifying and people continue to move in. The demand for housing in Flatbush is only increasing. “The people that are moving in and paying $3,000 are not getting heat either, and they're like ‘You're not getting us heat? We're leaving,’" said, Charles.</p>
