	<p>When looking at the data, most heating complaints came from Central Brooklyn, Northern Manhattan, and the South Bronx. These areas are commonly low income or gentrifying. Community District 14, which consists of Flatbush and Midwood, has history of having some of the highest number of “HEAT/HOT WATER” complaints in all of the five boroughs. </p>

	<p>Last winter’s cold storm some 15,000 people were left without heat in their buildings, causing Governor Andrew Cuomo to declare a state of emergency at the NYC Housing Authority. </p>

	<p> Vinesse Charles, Housing Coordinator at the Flatbush Development Cooperation, tells her clients that one call to 311 is not going to fix the issue. “You can't just whisper. One, call a month is a whisper. You need to scream ‘I need freaking hot water and heat,” she said.</p>

	<p> Limited resources prevent Housing Preservation and Development inspectors from getting to many of the issues reported. In the month of October alone, 311 received 3,583 complaints in Community District 14 alone. </p>

	<p> “Even if your situation is a whole lot smaller than somebody else's situation, you gotta make so much noise that they're running over,” said Charles. </p>

	<p>Many buildings in Norther Manhattan and Central Brooklyn are older and suffer lack of maintenance letting plumbing and electrical units left to deteriorate. The city’s Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) sends inspectors once issues are determined severe enough. Many of the buildings are larger and house more residents, which may cause the disparity in total number of 311 calls. </p>

	<p>The problems are expensive, and the city ends up footing the bill most of the time. After Cuomo declared a state of emergency, he ordered the appointment of an independent monitor, who would oversee how the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) would spend it’s $250 million budget to make emergency repairs to the city’s worst infrastructure. </p>
	
	<p>It’s tough to make the assertion that the lack of heat is tactic of tenant harassment. Landlords in Flatbush and other gentrifying areas are notorious for forcing tenants out by neglecting repairs and damaging personal property. Charles said, “I couldn't say for sure that it's a harassment tactic, I don't know that. It could be that it's too expensive to fix, a lot of these buildings are old.”</p>

	<p>A lot of these buildings are gentrifying and people continue to move in. The demand for housing in Flatbush and Harlem is only increasing. “The people that are moving in and paying $3,000 are not getting heat either, and they're like ‘You're not getting us heat? We're leaving,’" said, Charles.</p>

	<p>Buildings in the Bronx and Central Brooklyn again show that most of the severe cases of complaints and hot water issues stem from these ares. Many residents live in large apartment complexes that have been are decades old, and have been left to deteriorate. </p>

	<p>Although not represented in the data, the Patterson Houses in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx have routinely been left without any running water. The NYCHA apartment development houses over 1,700 apartments, and residents in 12 of the 25 buildings have had to resort to taking water from fire hydrants. </p>

	<p>Outdated heating pumps and a deteriorating boiler system have left hundreds of residents without running water for months, even though the NYCHA has told residents that funding for a new boiler system was approved back in 2011.</p>

	<p>“There’s no reason why our people here at Patterson Houses don’t have water and no reason why they have to come to the fire hydrant to get water. It’s demoralizing,” said Community Organizer Clarisa Alayeto. “This is happening over, and over and over again.” </p>
